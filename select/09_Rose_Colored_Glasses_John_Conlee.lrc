[00:15.17] I don't know why I keep on believing you need me
[00:23.07] When you've proved so many times that it ain't true
[00:30.08] And I can't find one good reason for staying
[00:36.33] Maybe by leaving would be the best for you
[00:57.33] 
[00:45.03] But these rose colored glasses
[00:52.78] That I'm looking through
[00:59.66] Show only the beauty
[01:07.22] 'Cause they hide all the truth
[01:22.22] 
[01:14.87] And they let me hold on to the good times, good lines
[01:22.32] The ones I used to hear when I held you
[01:29.46] And they keep me from feeling so cheated, defeated
[01:37.20] When reflections in your eyes show me a fool
[01:59.20] 
[01:44.67] These rose colored glasses
[01:52.23] That I'm looking through
[01:59.36] Show only the beauty
[02:06.96] 'Cause they hide all the truth
[02:21.96] 
[02:14.51] So I just keep on hopin', believin'
[02:20.59] That maybe by counting the many times that I've tried
[02:29.53] You'll believe me when I say, "I love you"
[02:35.43] And I'll lay these rose colored glasses aside
[02:57.93] 
[02:44.57] These rose colored glasses
[02:52.52] That I'm looking through
[02:59.63] Show only the beauty
[03:06.94] 'Cause they hide all the truth
