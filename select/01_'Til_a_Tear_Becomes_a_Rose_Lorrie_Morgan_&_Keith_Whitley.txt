Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose

Dearest love, I know your heart is shattered
And all my words can offer no relief
But my love will heal the pain you've suffered
And I'll be here if you should turn to me

Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose

In deepest nights when memories tend to gather
Lay with me and put your fears to sleep
'Cause there's no pain
No dream can put us under
All the love that binds you and me

Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right there to hold you
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
