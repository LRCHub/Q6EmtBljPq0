Her lips and her dress
They're both ruby red
She thinks that's how you hide
The pain you feel inside

And she comes out every night
To soak-up the neon light
Her perfume fills the air
People stop and stare

But Blue Rose is
Looking for the moon in someone's eyes
Blue Rose is
Willing to believe in someone's lies
Blue Rose is
Pedals have been crushed along the way
Oh Blue Rose is
Just growing bluer everyday

One more drink, one more dance
You might be her only chance
She needs someone to hold
When the night is growing old

And if you don't mind the thorns
She'll take you in and keep you warm
Lyin' in the dark
In a bed of broken hearts

But Blue Rose is
Looking for the moon in someone's eyes
Blue Rose is
Willing to believe in someone's lies
Blue Rose is
Pedals have been crushed along the way
Oh Blue Rose is
Just growing bluer everyday
