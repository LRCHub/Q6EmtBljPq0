[00:08.46] I'm playing
[00:09.44] all my cards
[00:10.58] I keep them close to my chest
[00:12.29] It don't phase me
[00:13.40] When they all think
[00:14.45] I'm so innocent, yeah
[00:15.57] I'm looking sweet,
[00:17.16] but I'm all dynamite
[00:18.64] (All dynamite)
[00:19.34] Don't believe me,
[00:21.01] when I say that I bite
[00:22.43] Go ahead and try, boy
[00:24.39] Try your best
[00:26.31] 知られてる通り I'm dangerous
[00:29.89] Ahh, 危ないの私は
[00:33.00] But you know
[00:34.23] that the choice is yours
[00:34.91] Oh, you might regret
[00:36.51] if you take that step
[00:38.49] Just like a rose
[00:40.48] トゲだらけの
[00:42.34] My heart ain't yours
[00:44.33] 醜い世界でも
[00:46.60] 咲いた 花 泥だらけでも
[00:49.99] I can't hide no more
[00:52.46] With my beautiful
[00:53.83] Thorns
[00:54.30] Yeah, いつでも人は過ぎ去った
[00:55.78] かれこれ時はだいぶ経った
[00:57.50] え、あいつ咲いた？
[00:58.40] いや多分死んだ
[00:59.42] この baddest
[01:00.14] トゲは自分に刺してた
[01:01.98] If you wanna get closer,
[01:04.18] you can't resist
[01:07.82] Then, baby, move in, get closer
[01:08.34] Can you handle it?
[01:09.16] Go ahead and try, boy
[01:10.48] Try your best
[01:12.35] 知られてる通り I'm dangerous
[01:15.93] Ahh, and so now
[01:17.88] that you've been warned
[01:19.05] You know that
[01:19.73] the choice is yours
[01:20.73] Oh, you might regret
[01:22.42] if you take that step
[01:24.87] Just like a rose

[01:40.34] 朝日は昇って but I can't see it
[01:41.90] (人らはしるよしもない)
[01:42.08] また眠りにつくこの現実に
[01:43.74] 汗や涙も枯れてきた頃に
[01:43.89] (私のトゲを飲んで)
[01:45.64] まだ立ち上がる私を疑い
[01:47.61] まだまだでもすくんだ足に
[01:48.77] (起き上がれない今日も)
[01:49.79] 命がまだあるらしい
[01:51.42] I can't give up まだこの世界に
[01:52.91] (生きてる事を憎んで)
[01:53.39] ありがたいと思いたいらしい
[01:55.38] Just like a rose
[01:57.72] トゲだらけの
[01:59.62] My heart ain't yours
[02:01.54] 醜い世界でも
[02:03.02] (誰もいないなら私が fly high
[02:03.41] 多少の傷ならもう I'm alright)
[02:04.32] 咲いた 花 泥だらけでも
[02:06.78] (今から行くから心配いらない)
[02:06.95] I can't hide no more
[02:08.85] (I'm alive now like
[02:09.71] bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom)
[02:10.71] Just like a rose
[02:12.93] トゲだらけの
[02:14.95] My heart ain't yours
[02:16.85] 醜い世界でも
[02:18.81] 咲いた 花 泥だらけでも
[02:22.17] I can't hide no more
[02:24.59] With my beautiful
[02:26.51] Thorns
[02:32.28] With my beautiful
[02:34.19] 咲いた 花 泥だらけでも
[02:37.56] I can't hide no more
[02:39.99] With my beautiful
[02:41.86] Thorns
